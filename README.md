## Functionality
This app will help you not only to track your cashflow by registering expenses and income, but also provide with some basic statistical summary.
Furthermore, it enables the export of the data in csv for further processing and compatibility with other software solutions.

## Instructions / User Guide
When the BudgetManager4U application is launched, a window opens showing the user's personal account. Here the user can monitor and manage their transactions, including both income and expenses. The following steps illustrate the process using an example income (salary) entry:

**Entering Income:**
To add an income transaction, for example a salary of â‚¬1000.00, enter the amount of the transaction in the top line. The application accepts both periods and commas as decimal separators and will automatically convert them if necessary. Immediately below, enter the date of the transaction (in this case, the salary) and optionally add a short description (e.g. 'monthly salary'). Once you have entered all the information correctly, click on the green 'Add Income' button. This will add the salary to the account, update the balance accordingly, and the income entry (highlighted in green) will automatically appear at the bottom of the recent transactions list. 
An overview of total income can be found in the top left tab, with the option to filter by specific dates. 

**Editing / Deleting a Transaction:**
If there are any errors in the transaction entry, or if an entry needs to be deleted, this can be done by clicking on the transaction in question. A window will appear with the options 'Edit', 'Delete' or 'Cancel'. Selecting "Edit" will reopen the transaction in the input fields at the top, where it can be modified as required. Selecting 'Delete' will remove the transaction permanently. If no changes are required, the transaction can be cancelled by selecting 'Cancel'.
